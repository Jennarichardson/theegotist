			  <div id="aboutcontent"> The Minneapolis Egotist is an anonymously-run website featuring the best creative, the best talent and the best resources in Minnesota – keeping it all in the greater context of what’s happening internationally. Our intent is to foster growth in our city and state, both professionally and conceptually.
			  	<br>
			  	<br>
			  	<br>

	<b> Manifesto </b>
	<br>
	<br>
	It is our belief, as creative participants in this city, that the opportunity for betterment lies at our feet and that it can happen by challenging one another, by holding each other accountable for our work, and by hiring and promoting local talent. This is our attempt to foster big ideas and radical thinking on a local level. To promote the best work and ideas in Minnesota. This is The Minneapolis Egotist, a means to an end.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	<b> A Message To Businesses </b>
	<br>
	<br>
	As decision makers on the client side and inside the agencies themselves, the choice to hire locally and demand good work is ours to make. By doing so, you’ll not only help elevate the city as a whole, you’ll help Minneapolis become a draw for new talent – continuing the cycle.

	Just as we’re challenging Minneapolis’s creative community to step it up, we’re also extending a challenge to business owners. Before you take your next big campaign out of town, give a shop in this city a chance – if only to pitch. The expectation for great work has been set. Let them surprise you. With your help and trust, we’ll build Minneapolis into a creative and cultural Mecca.

	We’re all about hiring the world’s best talent. But we’re all about hiring Minneapolis’s best talent first. It’s the challenge of agencies to uncover the photographers, illustrators, directors, writers, designers and visionaries in our town that will help make your work better every time they touch it. And then use them to raise the bar for the entire community.</div>
